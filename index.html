  <h3>Student at The University of Sydney</h3>
  <p>
  Hi! I am Thomas, an Honours student studying pure mathematics at The University of Sydney. Welcome to my Portfolio! ðŸ˜Š
  </p>

  <p>
  I am particularly interested in partial differential equations, spectral theory and functional analysis. 
  I have also dabbled in a few statistics and data science projects. Check them out in the Research tab.
  </p>

  <p> I've collated some awards and grades in the Education tab.</p>
  
  <p> I've also done some work with the University's Formula Student team. Check it out on the FSAE Blog. </p>
  
  <p> Feel free to contact me at {% highlight ruby %} H(dot)Zheng(at)maths.usyd.edu.au {% endhighlight %} if you see something on my website that you like or would like to discuss.</p>
